# laravel-learn-chirper

Building a Laravel application by following the tutorial at https://laravel.com/learn/getting-started-with-laravel

> [!NOTE]
> This is not my first web site I made using Laravel, but this is the first one I publish on GitHub.

> [!NOTE]
> The aforementioned tutorial includes a step to deploy this app, but I do not want to do it yet. So there is only the source code to browse (or clone and run yourself if you want).
